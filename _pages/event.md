### Parallel Computing in Chapel: An Introduction and mini Hack-a-Thon event
Has parallel programming always seen intriguing, but scary for you? Come by and learn how simple and approachable parallel programming can be through Crayâ€™s programming language, Chapel. Chapel is created with the intention to be a productive counterpart to C or C++ with OpenMP or MPI with competitive performance. We will go through a high-level description of Chapel, code up a simple parallel programming script together, and then open up the floor for attendees to try coding in Chapel by themselves through a mini hack-a-thon. We will present a problem with steps on how to solve it and the group(s) that create the best performing code will win some goodies! Come by to learn and have some fun with parallel programming.
